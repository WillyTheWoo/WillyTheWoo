\begin_layout Paragraph
Puzzle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Labor elasticity is important because it determines distortions introduced
 by taxes and employment response to fluctuations in productivity.
 Micro elasticity is 
\emph on
estimated
\emph default
 to be between 0 and 0.4, whereas the macro estimate 
\emph on
implies
\emph default
 an estimate between 2 to 4.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
This Paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Authors find that there is little relationship between micro and macro elasticit
ies of labor supply.
 This is because micro elasticities estimates only capture the intensive
 margin, whereas the macro elasticities must also capture the extensive
 margin.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prescott (AER, 2002) and others have argued that labour taxes explain a
 large share of the differences between time devoted to work in continental
 Europe versus the US (Europeans work about 70% of the US counterparts).
 People critique saying that plugging in micro labor elasticity invalidates
 Prescott's conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are low micro labor elasticity consistent with high macro estimates?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Study how tax and transfer policies affect hours work in the steady-state
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Key Element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-linearity in the mapping between time at work and labor services actually
 provided.
 A less important element is the heterogeneity across cohorts (young vs.
 old): productivity depends on age
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macro elasticities are unrelated to micro elasticities â€“ micro elasticities
 in the range [0.5, 1.25] can coexist with macro elasticities in the range
 [2.25, 3].

\begin_layout Enumerate
Human Capital (Imai & Keane, 2004).
 Elasticities should capture how labor supply varies with wages 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 human capital, whereas measured micro elasticities only capture how labor
 supply varies with wage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Key Element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Return to an hour of work is not only the after tax wage but also includes
 
\emph on
human capital
\emph default
 (HC), define as the expected present value of increased earnings in all
 future periods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since HC decreases with age, labor supply elasticity differs across ages.
 The tax change affects HC depending on whether it's temporary (in which
 case it does not affect HC) and it's permanent (in which case it does).

SAMPLE QUESTION:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem*
In their paper 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Micro and Macro Labor Supply Elasticities: A Reassessment of Conventional
 Wisdom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (JEL 2012), Keane and Rogerson discuss two main attempts at reconciling
 the discrepacny between micro and macro elasticities.
 Briefly describe the two approaches and the key model feature that accomplishes
 the task in each.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
The authors discuss two approaches.
 The first approach, by Rogerson & Wallenius, involves a convex labor schedule
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $e\left(a\right)\max\left\{ h-f,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $e\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 is the productivity that varies with age 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the up-front cost of entering the labor market.
 This allows the agents to optimally decide to enter the market (extensive
 margin) and also decide how many hours to work (intensive margin).
 The micro elasticities only capture the intensive margin, and this mechanism
 allows the two elasticities to be virtually unrelated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
The second approach, by Imai and Keane, argues that elasticities should
 capture how labor supply varies with wage 
\emph on
and 
\emph default
human capital; the measured elasticities only capture how labor supply varies
 with wage.
 In their model, the wages are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{t+1}=\left(1+\kappa\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}h_{t-j}\right)w_{1}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 represents the initial wage upon entering the market.
 In this setup, a unit increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 raises the wage by 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa w_{1}$
\end_inset

 in all future periods, so the return to an hour of work now consists of
 the after-tax wage 
\emph on
plus
\emph default
 the expected present value of increased earnings in future periods.

Basic idea is that investment in standard RBC is too volatile while consumption
 too smooth.
 Introducing home production allows more substitution into and out of market
 activity in response to shocks, so it helps relieve this puzzle.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Motivation
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does an RBC model with home production perform? Can it improve the fact
 that investment in standard RBC is too volatile while consumption in standard
 RBC is too smooth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introduce home production function into the model and expand household choices
 for allocating output.
 Then calibrate the resulting model.
 Finally, simulate the model to analyze its business cycle properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Key Element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original household choice was allocating output between consumption
 and investment; now they divide among consumption, investment in business
 capital, and investment in household capital.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incorporating home production outperforms standard RBC in matching (1) volatilit
ies of makret output, consumption and investment relative to market output,
 hours worked in the market relative to either market outpu or productivity
 and (2) correlations between investment in household and business capital.
 It still overstates the correlation between market hours & productivity
 and home & market investment.

\begin_layout Problem*
In their paper 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Putting Home Economics into Macroeconomics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (FRB-QR 1993), Greenwood, Rogerson, and Wright develop a model with home
 production.
 Briefly describe why they want to construct such a model and the key model
 feature that accomplished the task.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
The primary motivation for their paper is that investment in standard RBC
 model is too volatile while the consumption is too smooth.
 Furthermore, the significance of home production in economic activities
 has long been recognized, but its relevance for business cycle research
 has only been recently investigated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
The authors introduce a home production function into the model and expand
 the household choices for allocating output.
 Specifically, the household now divides output between consumption, investment
 in business capital, and investment in household capital.
 Since home production allows more substitution into and out of market activity
 in response to shocks, investment is less volatile to the standard RBC
 model.

\begin_layout Standard
Amount of equipment that can be purchased for one unit of output

 grows with the passage of time according to a Markov process.
 The law of motion for structures:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{s}'=\left(1-\delta_{s}\right)k_{s}+i_{s}
\]

\end_inset

is thus different from the law of motion for equipment: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{e}'=(1-\delta_{e})k_{e}+i_{e}q
\]

\end_inset

This implies that you have to investment in equipment to benefit from investment
-specific technological change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The balanced growth path shows that both the stock of equipment and new
 equipment investment grow at a higher rate than output.
 Furthermore, approximately 60% of post-war productivity growth can be attribute
d to investment-specific technological change.
 After accounting for this rapid improvement in production of capital goods,
 the productivity slowdown since the 1970s looks even worse.

Long-run implications of Investment-specific Technological Change
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (AER 1997), Greenwood, hercowitz, and Krusell modify a standard neoclassical
 growth model to investigate the role of investment-specific technological
 change.
 Briefly describe why they think such change may be a driver of economic
 growth and the key element in their model that accomplished the task.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
The paper is motivated by two key observations that suggest that investment-spec
ific technological change may be a factor in economic growth.
 First, the relative price of equipment has declined remarkably over the
 long-run while the equipment-to-GNP ratio has risen.
 Second, there is a negative correlation between the price for equipment
 and equipment investment/GNP in the short-run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
The authors assume a Markov process for the amount of equipment that can
 be purchased for one unit of output 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(q\right)$
\end_inset

 that grows with the passage of time.
 This creates a discrepancy in the law of motion for structures:
\begin_inset Formula

Real Business Cycles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (JPE 1983), Long and Plosser build a basic RBC model with rational expectations
, complete information, stable preferences and no serial dependence in shocks.
 Briefly explain how the model transforms and amplifies these i.i.d.
 shocks into output series that are (1) persistent and (2) co-move.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
The model successfully transforms and amplifies the i.i.d.
 shocks into output series that are persistent and exhibit co-movement across
 commodities.
 Persistence comes from the fact that the next-period production depends
 on the amount produced today and the shock next period, which is unobserved
 before making production decisions.
 The co-movement across commodities comes from the fact that multiple inputs
 are used to produce each single output, and outputs from previous periods
 are used as inputs to produce outputs next period.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two facts: (1) stock of household capital (durables + residential) is greater

\begin_layout Paragraph
Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How is the allocation of capital between the business and household sectors
 over the business cycle determined?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Beckerian model of household production that treats business and household
 sectors (almost) symmetrically.
 It's Beckerian in the sense that consumers value market goods and home
 goods, not directly leisure (so time is split between market and home good).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Key Element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only source of asymmetry between the two sectors is that capital can
 be produced in the market sector only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model can explain fact (1), but it cannot explain (2) even after increasing
 complementarity or adding capital adjustment costs.
 In general, any general equilibrium model with household durables would
 go against (2) since:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Positive technology shock increases optimal levels of B and HH capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since capital goods can only be produced in B, the consumption of market
 goods must be sacrificed, and thus market goods become more scarce.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This implies that it's more beneficial to invest in B (to relieve the excess
 demand), which leads to negative co-movement in B and HH investment.

 (JPE 1991), Greenwood and Hercowitz develop a model featuring household

 Explain the motivation behind the paper and the key element that delivers
 the result.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
The paper seeks to develop a model that explains two stylized facts; (1)
 stock of household capital is greater than the stock of business capital,
 and (2) investment in household capital is highly procyclical, leading
 business investment.
 To do so, they develop a Beckerian model of household production that treats
 business and household sectors almost symmetrically, where the only source
 of asymmetry between the two sectros is that capital can be produced in
 the market sector only.
 The model succeeds in explaining fact (1), but it cannot explain (2) even
 after adding increasing complementarity or adding capital adjustment costs.

\begin_layout Standard
Intuition: It's important to note that the risk-free rate and the risk premium
 are jointly determined in the economy.
 They cannot be simultaneously rationalized in a perfect market:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To explain the high risk premium observed in the market with this model,
 we need abnormally high rates of risk aversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you have high rates of risk aversion, they desire smooth consumption
 over time and therefore dislike growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
However, even though treausry bills offer only a low rate of return, individuals
 defer consumption (=save) at a sufficiently fast rate to generate a significant
 level consumption growth per year.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Main Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It cannot match the data â€“ requires impossible high risk aversion.
 The

equity premium puzzle
\emph default
 is therefore that the covariances of the return with consumption only explains
 the observed excess return if the agent is implausibly risk averse.

The low risk-free rate can be explained by alterations to any of the three
